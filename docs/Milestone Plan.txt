ðŸš€ 4-Milestone Implementation Plan
________________________________________
Milestone 1: Core Multi-Agent Workflow (MVP)
Goal: Establish the foundational LangGraph multi-agent system with sequential task execution.
Deliverables:
â€¢	Set up LangGraph orchestration with sequential agent-task workflow.
â€¢	Implement core agents:
o	News & Info Researcher (DuckDuckGo search).
o	Data Researcher (Yahoo Finance API).
o	Analyst (LLM-based synthesis).
o	Financial Expert (Buy/Hold/Sell recommendations).
â€¢	Integrate custom tools: stock price, company info, income statements.
â€¢	Produce outputs: Analysis.md + Recommendation.md.
â€¢	Basic CLI input for single stock queries.
Success Criteria:
â€¢	User can input a stock ticker and receive analysis + recommendation within 1 minute.
â€¢	Markdown files generated correctly.
Estimated Timeline: 3â€“4 weeks.

Milestone 2: Data Quality, Context & Explainability
Goal: Enhance outputs with richer data sources, formatting, and explainable insights.
Deliverables:
â€¢	Improve data cleaning & validation from Yahoo Finance API (handle missing fields, suffix issues like .NS).
â€¢	Expand news retrieval to include structured summaries & sentiment tagging.
â€¢	Ensure Analyst outputs are structured (valuation, risks, opportunities).
â€¢	Add explainability layer: reasons behind Buy/Hold/Sell in simple language.
â€¢	Logging & error handling for failed API calls.
Success Criteria:
â€¢	Outputs consistently contain valuation metrics, risks, and news impact.
â€¢	Recommendations always include explanation of reasoning.
â€¢	System handles invalid/missing stock symbols gracefully.
Estimated Timeline: 4â€“5 weeks.

Milestone 3: Scalability & UI Expansion
Goal: Make the system scalable and accessible to broader user groups.
Deliverables:
â€¢	Implement parallel stock processing (multi-threaded/multi-request handling).
â€¢	Build a basic Streamlit dashboard for non-technical users.
o	Input multiple tickers.
o	View analysis & recommendations interactively.
â€¢	Introduce batch run mode (portfolio-level advisory).
â€¢	Extend observability: execution time, logs, errors visible in UI.
Success Criteria:
â€¢	Users can analyze multiple stocks in one run.
â€¢	Streamlit UI allows non-technical users to interact without CLI.
â€¢	Portfolio-level output generated.
Estimated Timeline: 5â€“6 weeks.

Milestone 4: Advanced Features & Go-to-Market Readiness
Goal: Position the system for real-world usage by servicing companies, fintech partners, and advisors.
Deliverables:
â€¢	New Agents/Tools:
o	Risk Manager (stress testing, scenario modeling).
o	Compliance Checker (regulatory alignment).
o	Social Media Sentiment Analyzer (Twitter/Reddit).
â€¢	Go-to-Market Features:
