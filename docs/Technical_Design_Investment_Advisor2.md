# Technical and Design Document: Investment Advisor Multi-Agent System

## Abstract

The Investment Advisor Multi-Agent System is a sophisticated, production-ready AI-powered investment advisory platform that leverages multiple specialized agents orchestrated through LangGraph to provide comprehensive stock analysis and investment recommendations. The system integrates GROQ for large language model (LLM) inference, Yahoo Finance for financial data retrieval, DuckDuckGo for news aggregation, and a modular agent architecture for scalable, intelligent investment decision support. The platform supports both a modern Streamlit web interface and a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI), enabling flexible, secure, and extensible investment analysis workflows.

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

The complexity of modern financial markets and the need for data-driven investment decisions has created a demand for intelligent systems that can analyze vast amounts of financial data, news, and market information. The Investment Advisor Multi-Agent System addresses this by combining specialized AI agents with advanced LLM capabilities, providing both individual investors and financial professionals with powerful tools for comprehensive stock analysis, risk assessment, and investment recommendations.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Overview

The Investment Advisor system is organized into five main architectural layers:

- **User Interface Layer**: Dual interface—Streamlit web UI and CLI—for all investment analysis operations
- **Application Layer**: Core orchestration engine with LangGraph workflow management and agent coordination
- **Agent Layer**: Specialized AI agents for news analysis, financial data processing, market analysis, and investment recommendations
- **External Services**: LLM (GROQ), financial data (Yahoo Finance), and news search (DuckDuckGo) integrations
- **Data Storage**: File system organization for analysis outputs, recommendations, logs, and configuration

### 2.2 Component Architecture

The system employs a multi-agent architecture where each agent specializes in specific aspects of investment analysis:

- **News Agent**: Gathers and analyzes company-related news, press releases, and market sentiment
- **Data Agent**: Retrieves and processes financial statements, market data, and performance metrics
- **Analyst Agent**: Synthesizes information into comprehensive financial and contextual analysis
- **Financial Expert Agent**: Generates investment recommendations with confidence levels and target prices

### 2.3 LangGraph Workflow Orchestration

The system uses LangGraph to orchestrate agent interactions through a directed graph workflow:

![LangGraph Workflow](diagrams/langgraph_workflow.jpg)

*Figure 2: LangGraph workflow orchestration showing agent interaction sequence and data flow*

The workflow follows this pattern:
```
News Agent → Data Agent → Analyst Agent → Financial Expert Agent
     ↓           ↓           ↓              ↓
  News Data → Financial → Analysis → Recommendation
```
